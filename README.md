## 🚀 What I'm Working On

As I look for my next position, I am currently dedicating regularly scheduled blocks of time to work on bug bounty programs and vulnerability disclosure programs(VDPs).  Studying real environments with real rules of engagement is always valuable experience.

I am also working through practical cybersecurity-related lessons on learning platforms (Portswigger, TryHackMe, etc) and learning related tools that might be useful in bug bounty engagements. I have also been thinking about implementing and/or customizing my own tools to support my bug bounty workflow, so I've been working on my Golang programming.

I recently completed the TryHackme Security Engineer learning path.

Let's make the digital world a better place, one secure connection at a time! 🛡️
